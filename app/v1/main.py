## Overview

This API can be used to get vital information on major international airports.

- Name of the airport
- City or the airport

## Usage

Retrieve a list of all airports by sending a `GET` request to `/airports`.

```shell
curl --request GET \
--url https://api.traefik-airlines/v1/airports/airports \
--header 'Accept: application/json'
```

If you want to request information on a certain airport use the airport `ID`.

```shell
curl --request GET \
--url https://api.traefik-airlines/v1/airports/airports/{ID} \
--header 'Accept: application/json'
```

### Response codes

If the status returned is in the `200` range, it indicates that the request was fulfilled successfully and that no error was encountered.

Return codes in the `400` range indicate that there was an issue with the request that was sent.

### Versioning

This API uses semantic versioning to ensure that your client doesn't break.  
The version is declared in the URL so that you can lock to a specific one by prefix the URL.

When the version declared in the URL is not supported, you will receive a 400 response.


This API helps you do awesome travel stuff. ðŸš€

    It basically sends a GET request to the route & hopes to get a "200"
    response code. Failing to return a 200 response code just enables
    the GitHub Actions to rollback to the last version the project was
    found in a "working condition". It acts as a last line of defense in
    case something goes south.
